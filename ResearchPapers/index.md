The theme for ICSOB 2024 revolves around the critical and timely topics of ethics, equity, and sustainability within the software business sector. In an era where digital transformation is ubiquitous, it's imperative to consider the ethical implications and equitable practices, as they are intrinsically linked to the sustainability of software initiatives, vital to realizing social justice, human rights, and democracy.
